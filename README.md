# How this flaw works ??
So, zee5 has their own API used to get all relevant data about that stuff with id.
## https://gwapi.zee5.com/content/details/${id}?translation=en&country=IN&version=2
We need to pass id and access token while making request and the server will return us with useful data.
We will get our accesstoken from this url :-
